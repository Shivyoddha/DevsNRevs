      <p class="best-suggested-food">German Shepherds requirea diet rich in high-quality animal-based protein to support their muscle developmentand overallenergy needs. Look for dog foods
with realmeatas the primary ingredient, such aschicken, beef, or fish. Ensurethat the dog food providesa balanced blend of protein, fats,and carbohydrates.
German Shepherdsareactive dogs, so they need a diet that provides sufficientenergy and nutrients to sustain theiractivity level. This breed is proneto hip and
joint issues, so a dog food with added glucosamineand chondroitin can help support their joint health. Look for dog foods thatcontain omega-3 fatty acids,
such as thosefound in fish oil. Thesefatty acids help maintain healthy skin,coat,and can reduceinflammation. Avoid dog foods thatcontain excessivefillers
likecorn, soy,and wheat,as they providelittle nutritional valueand can lead to digestiveissues in some dogs. Opt for dog foods that don'tcontain artificial
colors, flavors, or preservatives. German Shepherds have different nutritional needsas puppies,adults,and seniors. Choosea dog food tailored to your dog's
lifestage.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="possible-ailments">Rabies:
- Causes: Rabies iscaused bytherabiesvirus, which is typicallytransmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal, most commonly
dogs, bats, raccoons, and skunks.
- Symptoms: Initialsymptoms of rabies mayresembletheflu and includefever, headache, and weakness. As thevirus progresses, it af ects the
central nervous system, leading to symptoms such as anxiety,confusion, hallucinations,excessive drooling, dif icultyswallowing, and even
paralysis.
- Remedies: Oncesymptoms appear, rabies is almost always fatal. However, immediate medical attention iscrucial afterexposureto potentially
infected animals. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) involves a series of vaccines and immunoglobulin injections to prevent thevirus from
spreading in the body.
Lupus:
- Causes: Theexact cause of lupus is unknown, but it is believed to be a result of a combination of genetic,environmental, and hormonal
factors.
- Symptoms: Symptoms of lupusvary widely but often includefatigue, joint pain/swelling, skin rashes (particularly on theface),chest pain, hair
loss, sensitivityto sunlight, and fever. In severecases, lupuscan af ect major organs such as thekidneys, heart, or brain.

monitor thecondition.
Alzheimer's disease:
- Causes: Alzheimer's diseaseis not fully understood, but it is associated with a buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, which
disrupt normal brain function. Geneticfactors, aging, and variousenvironmental factors are believed to beinvolved in its development.
- Symptoms: Alzheimer's is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder,characterized by memoryloss,confusion, disorientation, language
dif iculties, mood swings, and eventually, dif iculties with basic daily activities.
