## DevsNRevs : Unleashing the Future of Dog Wellness
### Description :
Welcome to our Pet Disease Identification website! This platform is designed to assist in the identification of diseases in pets, with a special focus on skin diseases, especially in dogs. We have meticulously curated a database for approximately 20 common skin diseases in dogs to provide you with accurate results.

This project was developed on the course of submission for <b>BITS Pilani Postman API Hackathon 3.0</b>

### How It Works:

1. <b>Image Input:</b> Users can upload images of their pets and provide additional details about the dog, including its name, age, breed, and activity level. This information helps in narrowing down the potential diseases.

2. *Machine Learning Model:* Your input is then processed by a machine learning model that we've developed. This model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset that we prepared, ensuring high accuracy in disease detection.

3. *Top 3 Disease Identification:* The model identifies the top three possible diseases based on the input data. It does this by leveraging our custom APIs hosted on Hugging Face.

4. *Detailed Disease Report:* A comprehensive report is generated, detailing the identified diseases, their causes, symptoms, and recommended remedies. This information is provided with the assistance of ChatGPT from OpenAI, which uses its powerful natural language understanding capabilities.

5. *Additional Information:* We have integrated APIs for the number of cups of food, nutritional information, and dog images for various breeds, hosted on Hugging Face. Additionally, we extend our gratitude to Postman for their invaluable assistance in utilizing these APIs.

6. *Downloadable Report:* Users can easily download the generated report. This report serves as a valuable reference and empowers pet owners to take informed action regarding their pet's health.

### *Impact and Accessibility:*

Our platform aims to address the needs of pet owners, particularly in rural areas of India and beyond. In regions where access to veterinary care is limited, our website can be a lifeline for pet owners. The ability to identify potential health issues in pets early can make a significant difference in their well-being.

### *Revolutionary Application:*

In essence, this website represents a revolutionary step in the field of pet health. It combines cutting-edge machine learning, natural language processing, and custom APIs to offer a comprehensive solution for identifying and understanding pet diseases. We are proud to offer this service and hope that it proves to be a valuable resource for pet owners everywhere. 

Please note that while our platform can provide initial insights, it is not a substitute for professional veterinary care. If you receive concerning results, it is always advisable to consult a qualified veterinarian for a thorough evaluation and appropriate treatment.

Thank you for choosing our Pet Disease Identification Website. We are committed to helping you keep your beloved pets healthy and happy.
